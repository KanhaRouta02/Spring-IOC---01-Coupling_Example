==================
-> Car is extending Engine class.

-> Car class can't use inheritance in future.

-> Any changes in Engine class will effect on Car class.

-> Car is tightly coupled with Engine.

Note: It is not recommended to develop classes with Tightly coupling.

-> Car is directly creating Object for Engine.

-> Any changes to Engine class will effect on Car class.

-> Car is always talking to only one Engine.

-> If i want to change from one Engine to another Engine then we should modify Car class code.
